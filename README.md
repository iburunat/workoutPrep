Applescript Automator workflow for kicking off your workout in one click

During the pandemic many had to set up a regular workout schedule at home to keep sane and sound. 
With automating the tabata interval training timer + workout playlist in one keyboard shortcut, those tiny actions become from pesky to perky :)

This two bits of AppleScript code can be set in Automator. 
They work fine in MacOS Catalina >10.15.

# START SPOTIFY WORKOUT PLAYLIST
The first script opens Spotify and starts playing the playlist of choice.

# OPEN TABATATIMER.com ON CHROME
The second script opens a new page on Chrome with the interval training site of choice (tabatatimer.com in this case), and starts the count down. This is the page on view.

Enjoy!
